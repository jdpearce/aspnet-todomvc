ASP.NET Todo MVC with Knockout.js and Web API
===

This is a simple implementation of the Knockout.js TodoMVC project which uses ASP.NET Web API for backend storage rather than localStorage.

### How to build

  This was built with VS 2012 Express for Web. You might be able to get this to build with VS 2010, but it will probably require some jiggery-pokery that I haven't tried.
